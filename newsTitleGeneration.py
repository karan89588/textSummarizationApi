One day, the farmer thought that if he could get more such golden eggs and make a lot of money and become a wealthy person. The farmer decided to cut the goose and remove all the golden eggs from its stomach. As soon as they killed the bird and opened the gooseâ€™s stomach, they found no eggs. The foolish farmer realized they had destroyed their last resource out of greed. '''))
